  "description": "This value set is intended to contain allowable values for the T category, according to TNM staging rules. AJCC codes (preferably, version 8 for current cancers) SHOULD be used.\n\n* AJCC terminology: examples of T categories include 'cTX', used when the tumor primary tumor cannot be evaluated, 'pT0', denoting there is no evidence of a primary tumor, and 'pTis', referencing carcinoma in situ (with some cancer-specific exceptions). Other T categories refer to increasing size of the primary tumor. Please note allowable T categories may vary between clinicalÂ and pathologic classifications. The full set of allowable clinical and pathologic T categories, along with its current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.",
